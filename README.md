# Docker

Self-hosting is the practice of running and maintaining a website or service using a private web server, instead of using a service outside of your own control.

These are the how-to-install notes of self-hosted apps I personally using or have used.

> You can use these on any system you can install `Docker` on, be it on Unix-based or Windows machine

> The majority of the apps are installed using `Docker Compose` format inside `Portainer`

> PIRACY DISCLAIMER
> 
> It's crucial to understand that while my notes *can* theoretically be used with pirated media, I do **not** endorse or support piracy.
